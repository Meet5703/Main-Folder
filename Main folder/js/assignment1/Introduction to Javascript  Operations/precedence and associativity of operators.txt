Precedence:
            Precedence refers to the priority or order of operations among different types of operators.
    Importance:
             It defines which operator gets executed first in an expression.


Associativity:
             Associativity determines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated when they appear together.
    Importance: 
            It clarifies the order of evaluation when multiple operators with the same precedence level are used.

Why  its Important??

Correctness: Knowing operator precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly according to mathematical rules.


Clarity: Understanding associativity prevents ambiguity in expressions where operators of the same precedence are used.


Predictability: It helps in predicting the outcome of complex expressions and avoids unintended behavior.
