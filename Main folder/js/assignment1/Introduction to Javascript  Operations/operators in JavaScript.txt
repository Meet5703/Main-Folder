Operators enable arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), allowing developers to perform mathematical computations within programs.

They help manipulate values by assigning, comparing, or modifying data, facilitating tasks like assigning values to variables (=), comparing values (==, ===, <, >, etc.), and modifying values in-place (e.g., +=, -=, ++, --).
