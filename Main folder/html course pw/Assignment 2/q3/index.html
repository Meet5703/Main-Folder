        <h1>My Self</h1>

        <p>
            Hello, Sir! My name is Meet S Khetani. I am a recent diploma civil engineering graduate from the class of 2022, achieving distinction with an impressive 8.46 CGPA. Following my diploma, I pursued courses in CAD design and became a proficient 3D artist. However, civil engineering and CAD design weren't where my true passion lay. I had a deep-seated interest in coding, a passion that I'd nurtured since my 7th-grade years. Unfortunately, after completing my 10th grade, I felt compelled to pursue civil engineering and CAD courses due to family expectations.

            Fast forward to the present, after completing my education, I found myself without a job. It was then that my family, understanding the struggles I faced, decided to support me in pursuing my true passion. I revisited my earlier aspiration of becoming a skilled coder, a dream I'd held since childhood. I shared my ambitions with my father, who had initially stood by me in my pursuit of civil engineering. He was not only supportive but also understanding of my desire to switch career paths.

            With my father's unwavering support, I embarked on my coding journey. I enrolled in courses at PW Skills to acquire the skills I needed to excel in the world of coding. I am genuinely dedicated to this new path, and I am committed to learning and growing in the field. I am grateful for the opportunity to follow my passion for coding, and I am excited to see where this journey will lead me.
